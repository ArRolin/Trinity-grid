# Trinity-grid
Because we mostly doesn't need to have up to 12 columns

## Usage 
In order to create a Trinity grid, you have to define the trinity frame. 
The best way is to use the body tag, and give it a trinity class :
```markup 
<body class="trinity">...</body>
```

Then you can use the grid : 

```Markup
<div class="t-1"></div>

<div class="t-2"></div>
<div class="t-2"></div>

<div class="t-3"></div>
<div class="t-3"></div>
<div class="t-3"></div>
```
